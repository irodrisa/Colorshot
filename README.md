# Colorshot - Web Edition

Welcome to Colorshot Web! This application allows you to upload an image and see it displayed full screen. But that's not all! It then uses the power of the Gemini API to analyze the image and identify a dominant color, which is then displayed in a sleek, semi-transparent banner at the top of the screen.

## Features

*   **Image Upload**: Easily upload images from your local device.
*   **Full-Screen Display**: View your uploaded image in a full-screen, immersive mode.
*   **AI-Powered Color Detection**: Leverages the Gemini API (1.5 Flash model) to intelligently determine a key color from the image.
*   **Dynamic Banner**: The identified color name is shown in a banner overlay. If the API is unavailable or a color cannot be determined, appropriate messages are displayed.

## Project Origin

This whole project is built by the new **Jules.google** AI agent!

*This project was developed with pure digital intuition â€“ some might call it 'vibe coding'. If it works, it works!*
